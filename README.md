# Map-Thingy-With-Vehicles
I tried to create a basic system where you can view your vehicles on a map and move them around using neighbourhood graph.

Most of the menus are in Turkish but it is easy to understand.

What you can do is; Add vehicles to the map, give them a task, send them to a location or region. They will use the graph as a road to travel across the map.
